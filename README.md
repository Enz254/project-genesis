## Overview

Project Genesis is a hands-on learning initiative that allows you to build and manage a multi-service application within a modern DevOps ecosystem. This project serves as a real-world sandbox, demonstrating best practices across various disciplines, including:

- DevOps
- Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
- DevSecOps
- FinDevOps

This repository aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of these disciplines through practical application. By engaging with this project, you will gain valuable insights into building resilient and scalable applications.

## Technologies Used

Project Genesis leverages a variety of technologies to create a robust and efficient application environment. The key technologies include:

- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
- **Docker**: Containerization platform
- **GitOps**: Managing infrastructure and applications using Git
- **Grafana**: Monitoring and observability tool
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform
- **Microservices Architecture**: Design approach for building applications
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring and alerting toolkit
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for communication between services
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store
- **SRE**: Focus on reliability and uptime

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git**: Version control system
- **Docker**: For containerization
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestration
- **kubectl**: Command-line tool for Kubernetes
- **Helm**: Package manager for Kubernetes
- **Node.js**: For running JavaScript applications (if applicable)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Enz254/project-genesis.git
   cd project-genesis
   ```

2. **Set Up Docker**

   Ensure Docker is running. You can start Docker Desktop or use the command line to start Docker.

3. **Build the Docker Images**

   Run the following command to build the Docker images defined in the `Dockerfile`:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

4. **Deploy to Kubernetes**

   Use Helm to deploy the application to your Kubernetes cluster:

   ```bash
   helm install project-genesis ./charts/project-genesis
   ```

5. **Access the Application**

   Once deployed, you can access the application through the service defined in your Kubernetes setup.

## Project Structure

The structure of the Project Genesis repository is organized as follows:

```
project-genesis/
â”œâ”€â”€ charts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ project-genesis/
â”œâ”€â”€ docker/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ database/
â”œâ”€â”€ kubernetes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deployment.yaml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ setup.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main/
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- **charts/**: Contains Helm charts for deploying the application.
- **docker/**: Contains Dockerfiles for different services.
- **kubernetes/**: Contains Kubernetes configuration files.
- **scripts/**: Contains utility scripts for setup and management.
- **src/**: Contains the source code for the application.

## Usage

Once you have the application running, you can interact with it using the following endpoints:

- **API Endpoints**: Access the RESTful API at `http://<your-service-url>/api`.
- **Dashboard**: Access the Grafana dashboard at `http://<your-service-url>/grafana`.

For detailed API documentation, refer to the `docs/` directory in the repository.

## Features

Project Genesis includes several features designed to enhance your learning experience:

- **Multi-Service Architecture**: Understand how to build and manage multiple services that communicate with each other.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Learn how to set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline.
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Use Grafana and Prometheus to monitor application performance.
- **Scalability**: Implement Kubernetes to manage scaling and high availability.
- **Security**: Explore DevSecOps practices to secure your application.
